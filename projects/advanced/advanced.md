# Advanced

In this project, you will apply advanced skills. This project builds on top of
the intermediate project. Every features from the intermediate projects will be
included in this project unless it has been overridden by features in this
project. This project focuses on production-ready applications.

## Skills

The following skills will be applied:

- Dependency management
- Databases
- Testing
- Performance
- Packaging
- Deployment

## Features

- Save to database for persistent storage.
- Tested.
- Improved performance.
- Packaged and deployed.

## Tasks

### Required

#### Manage dependencies

Use at least one external dependency. The dependencies need to be installed from 
either the standard library or third-party providers. If all utilities in the 
standard library don't have to be installed, use third-party modules. If your 
language does not have third party dependencies, create modules to simulate this.

#### Use a Database Management System

Create and use a database for the todos. Update the database as per user 
actions. Use a database management system. If there are neither built-in nor 
third-party utilities, build your own simple DBM. You can use a remote database 
if you like.

#### Test Your Code

Through out the development process, write tests for your functions, objects, 
and the like.

#### Improve Your App's Performance

Rewrite your code to be faster and more memory efficient. You can do this by 
improving the functions you have written, using different data structures, or 
using different build-in utilities. For custom functions and data structures, 
measure the performance to be sure.

#### Package Your App

Use a package manager and/or compiler to create a package for your app. If your 
language doesn't support packaging, use NPM or similar tools.

#### Deploy Your App

Publish your app for others to use. If your language not have the necessary 
tools for this, use NPM or similar tools.

### Optional

#### Swipe

For a GUI program, add swipe functionality (if possible). Let the user swipe 
right to mark the todo as done. Let the user swipe left to delete a todo. The 
swipe action can take effect immediately or show a button which can be clicked 
to complete the action.
